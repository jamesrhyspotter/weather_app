# Flutter Weather App

Task Description:
Your task is to develop a Flutter weather application that fetches real-time weather data from an API and presents it in a user-friendly interface. The app should provide current weather information, as well as a 5-day forecast for a selected location. You are expected to demonstrate your proficiency in Flutter development, including UI design, data retrieval, and state management.

## Task Requirements:

### User Interface:
- The app should have a clean and intuitive user interface (UI) design.
- Display the current weather conditions, including temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and an appropriate weather icon.
- Provide a search functionality to allow users to enter a location and fetch weather data for that location.
- Display a 5-day forecast with the date, weather icon, and maximum and minimum temperatures for each day.
- Implement proper error handling and display informative messages to the user in case of network errors or invalid location searches.
- Design the UI to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
### Data Retrieval:
- Fetch weather data from a public weather API of your choice (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, etc.).
- Utilize appropriate API endpoints to retrieve current weather data and forecast data.
- Handle API requests and responses appropriately, including error handling and parsing of the received data.
- Ensure the app updates the weather data periodically or allows manual refresh to fetch the latest information.

### State Management:
- Utilize a state management approach (e.g., Provider, BLoC) to manage the app's state effectively. 
- Handle loading, success, and error states when fetching weather data. 
- Implement appropriate state management for UI components, such as handling user interactions and updating the UI based on retrieved data.

### Code Quality:
- Write clean, modular, and maintainable code.
- Implement appropriate separation of concerns (e.g., UI components, data retrieval, state management). 
- Follow Flutter best practices and conventions. 
- Properly organise the project structure and use meaningful variable and function names. 
- Add comments to explain complex logic or functionality.

### Testing:
- Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of critical app functionality. 
- Test the app's state management and handling of different scenarios, such as successful data retrieval, network errors, and invalid location searches. 
- Aim for a reasonable test coverage to demonstrate your testing skills.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Git Repository
2. Include a README file in the repository that explains how to run the app and any additional information you think is relevant.
3. Commit your code regularly with descriptive commit messages.
